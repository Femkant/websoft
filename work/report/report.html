                        This is my reflection on lecture one and creating github pages. The whole concept "github pages"
                        was
                        new
                        to me.
                        Otherwise I have
                        been using github for all my projects since the first year at HKR.
                        I have created a website before. In the last project course I was in the website group. We used
                        Vue.js
                        to create it.
                        In the
                        examnination course I will be working in Angular.

                        Today I learned about github pages. Im looking forward to learn vanilla javascript since all
                        I've
                        been
                        using before

                    <p>
                        Today I've been working with CSS and HTML code. I do have some previous experience within both
                        of
                        them since I've
                        been working on websites before. When it comes to vanilla javascript, I dont have that much
                        experience because
                        I have previously been using typescript. A lot of things are the same though.
                        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
                            Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
                        </p>
                        The browser sends an HTTP-request to a webserver which replies with an HTTP-response. The
                        response
                        is often
                        a new HTML document. The HTTP protocol is the most commonly used data transfer protocol on the
                        internet and
                        works on the
                        application layer. HTTP uses TCP so a handshake is necessary and a connection will be
                        established
                        between
                        the browser and the webserver.

                        Today I learned a lot about what is posible to do with only CSS. In a very short perios of time
                        I
                        found a lot of new features that I didn't know of.

                    <p>I find it very fun to work on this project. I spend a lot of time on it! Some of the code looks
                        like in
                        Angular or Vue but somehow I find it easier to learn vanilla Javascript. I would not say that I
                        have
                        previous experience in client side Javascript. Atleast not like this.
                        Javascript is not really comparable to other languages that I've used but some things are
                        similar and
                        that makes it a whole lot easier.
                        I aimed for the higest grade, mostly because I thought it was really fun. I have not been using
                        the code
                        examples very much. Instead I used google. Google is a quite good friend of mine!

                        Today I learned a lot. I don't even know where to begin. My overall knowledge of
                        javascript/html/css has
                        increased quite a bit. I also learned a lot about managing JSON files, that was probably the
                        most tricky bit
                        on this task.

                    <p>I have worked a little with node/npm before when I've been doing Vue or Angular projects.
                        I like working with these kind of tools but it is very much you must understand before it makes sence.
                        Because I'm also doing the degree project at the same time as this course, I had to focus on that for a bit
                        and therefor I only did the requirements for grade 3 on this task. The task was simple enough but it still covered 
                        the creation of an express application!

                        I learned more about express and nodejs. I also increased my overall knowledge of web-programming.

                    <p>As Mikael said on the lecture, we only covered a bit of vanilla php, so it's hard to feel 
                        a certain way about this language. The little we did do was nice and easy to implement. It was 
                        a nice addition to vanilla javascript and html. Being able to add components instead of rewriting 
                        the code in all the html files is to me an absolute necessity. 
                        Comparing php to other languages is also hard to do with only basic knowledge but i guess i see some  
                        simularities to javascript and typescript.
                        I did aim for grade 5 in this one, but I did not finish the last step on the grade 5 requirements.

                        Before this excercise i did not know how to use php at all, so I'd say I learned a lot. I also 
                        increased my knowledge about HTML forms and database connections.

                    <p>I dont really know why it would matter for a programming language to be popular. I guess 
                        you can assume that it offers something nice if it's gaining popularity, but as long as you 
                        can reach the same end result without wasting time, there's really no need to change anything.
                        Im doing my degree project for a company which uses Angular so
                        I'm going to write my degree project in Angular even if it is not as popular as it used to be. 
                        I have tried both Angular and Vue and I very much prefer Angular in that case.
                        I chose to compare Angular and Vue at google trends and it shows that Vue has a higher average interest 
                        over time but I also noticed that in China Vue has 87% versus Angular's 13%. This country alone changes 
                        the world average significantly. In sweden, Angular has a bigger interest than Vue.
                        To recommend a framework to a potential employer I would definitaly need more knowledge than I currently have.
                        But, if the employer would ask me, I'd probably recommend React based on stateofjs.com. I myself have never 
                        tried it so the suggestion would be 100% based on this comparison.

                            Today I Learned
                        </p>
                        I learned a lot about different frameworks and their popularity. I was accually not expecting Angular to be on the 
                        negative side of the opinions line, based on the positive experiences I've had myself.
