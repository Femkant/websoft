            <p>This is my reflection on lecture one and creating github pages. The whole concept "github pages" was new
                to me.
                Otherwise I have
                been using github for all my projects since the first year at HKR.
                I have created a website before. In the last project course I was in the website group. We used Vue.js
                to create it.
                In the
                examnination course I will be working in Angular.
                Today I learned about github pages. Im looking forward to learn vanilla javascript since all I've been
                using before
                has been
                typescript.</p>
