            <p>My name is Oskar Karström, born and raised in Rinkaby, Skåne, just outside of Kristianstad. I studied to
                a
                woodworker at Wendesgymnasiet in Kristianstad but started working as a paver instead. I kept working as
                a
                paver on different companies for almost 8 years. I then realized that I wanted to do something else and
                started my studies at Kristianstad univerity. In a few months I will get my bachelor in software
                development.</p>

            <p>I have always had an interest in computers and computer games. Programming for me started when I created
                cheats and bots for games.</p>

            <p>My hobbies outside of computers and programming is hiking and hanging out with my friends. I also like
                movies
                a lot.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading my short presentation!</p>
